# stein.js
My take on some standard classes useful for making a modular, decoupled JS structure for non-JS oriented backends (e.g. PHP apps)


# Important
These classes are ES6 (ES2015), so transpile them with Webpack+Babel!

# Tip

- Use my boilerplate at https://github.com/Milanzor/ck-boilerplate

# Note
This is very opinionated and also made while learning JavaScript design patterns, Webpack and ES6+, so...
